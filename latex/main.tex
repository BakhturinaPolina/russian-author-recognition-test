\section*{Abstract}
\noindent
The Author Recognition Test (ART) is an established proxy measure of print exposure. This report summarizes psychometric analyses of a Russian-language ART administered online to \textbf{N = \N} adults. Author items were analyzed with a two-parameter logistic (2PL) Item Response Theory (IRT) model. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) indicated a dominant factor consistent with a largely unidimensional print-exposure construct. Item parameters showed a wide difficulty range and generally strong discrimination (mean discrimination \(\approx 1.47\)). The test information function peaked near average ability levels (around \(\theta \approx 0\)), with lower precision at the extremes. A \ShortItems-item short form retained approximately 77\% of full-test information and correlated strongly with full-scale ability estimates (\(r \approx .97\)). Results support the Russian ART as a reliable, culturally grounded indicator of print exposure.

\section{Introduction}
Print exposure---accumulated experience with written texts---predicts vocabulary growth, reading fluency, and comprehension. The Author Recognition Test (ART) provides a fast proxy for print exposure by measuring recognition of real author names while discouraging indiscriminate responding via foils (non-authors). Because author familiarity is culturally contingent, each language community requires a locally grounded ART.

The present report focuses on the psychometric evaluation of a Russian ART pretest dataset using IRT. We emphasize interpretability (difficulty, discrimination, information), short-form construction, and structural comparison to English ART IRT work (e.g., \citealp{moore2015reading}), without mapping item identities across languages.

\section{Method}

\subsection{Participants}
The analyzed dataset includes \textbf{N = \N} adult native speakers of Russian recruited online. [Add recruitment channels, age range, inclusion/exclusion, ethics/informed consent.]

\subsection{Materials: Russian ART}
The full instrument contained \textbf{\FullItems} scored author items and foils. Author selection followed Russian ART development criteria: fiction-only inclusion; exclusion of non-fiction/public-intellectual names; and empirical grounding in reading-market and reader-platform visibility rather than school curricula. Foils were constructed to be plausible personal names but not fiction authors. [Add exact sources and exclusion rules from your Russian ART paper.]

\subsection{Procedure}
Participants completed an online checklist ART. They marked names they believed were real authors and were warned that selecting foils would reduce their score. [Add details: randomized order, image-based presentation to prevent searching, time constraints if any.]

\subsection{Analytic Strategy}
\textbf{Dimensionality.} We examined unidimensionality using EFA and parallel analysis.\\
\textbf{IRT model.} We fitted a 2PL model with item difficulty \(b\) and discrimination \(a\).\\
\textbf{Precision.} We evaluated the test information function (TIF) and standard errors across \(\theta\).\\
\textbf{Short form.} We constructed a \ShortItems-item form prioritizing high-information items and coverage across the difficulty continuum.\\
\textbf{Scoring.} We compared IRT \(\theta\) to classical scores (hits minus false alarms) and related variants.

\section{Results}

\subsection{Data Quality and Convergence}
The dataset included responses from two recruitment sources (Source 1: $n = 800$; Source 2: $n = 1{,}035$). A small proportion of item responses were missing (1,168 cells across 19 columns). Classical scores (hits minus false alarms) averaged $M = 38.43$ ($SD = 20.52$), with mean false-alarm rate of 8.4\%.

\centering
\caption{Data quality and convergence summary}
\label{tab:data_quality}
\input{tables/table_data_quality.tex}
\end{table}

\subsection{Dimensionality (EFA)}
EFA showed a strong first factor (eigenvalue = 21.44, explaining 23.1\% of variance) and a steep eigenvalue drop thereafter (second factor eigenvalue = 9.81), consistent with a dominant print-exposure dimension. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy was excellent (KMO = 0.97). Parallel analysis suggested that additional factors, if present, were substantially smaller and likely reflect residual structure (e.g., clusters of author familiarity by genre or era).

\input{tables/table_eigenvalues.tex}
\end{table}

\subsection{Model Fit}
We compared a 1-factor versus 2-factor structure for descriptive purposes. The 2-factor model improved variance explained modestly (from 23.1\% to 33.6\%), but the dominant first factor supports reporting a primary \(\theta\) estimate for most applications.

\end{table}

\subsection{Item Parameters and Item Quality Flags}
Difficulty \(b\) indexes how widely known an author is (higher \(b\) = harder), and discrimination \(a\) indexes how diagnostic an item is (higher \(a\) = stronger separation). Difficulty parameters ranged from $b = -3.10$ (Agatha Christie) to $b = +5.11$ (Jostein Gaarder), with mean $b = 0.34$ ($SD = 1.57$). Discrimination parameters ranged from $a = 0.21$ to $a = 3.36$, with mean $a = 1.47$ ($SD = 0.62$).

We flagged items with low discrimination ($a < 0.5$; $n = 5$) or extreme difficulty ($|b| > 3.0$; $n = 7$) as candidates for revision or omission in short forms.

\subsection{High-Reader vs Low-Reader Signal Items (Authors)}
To make test design transparent, we identify two sets of items with ``decent'' discrimination (e.g., \(a \ge 1.0\)): (a) the hardest discriminating items (high-reader signal) and (b) the easiest discriminating items (low-reader signal). These sets anchor interpretation at both ends of the ability continuum.

\input{tables/table_easy_items.tex}
\end{table}

\subsection{Item Characteristic Curves and Item Information}
ICCs show how recognition probability changes with \(\theta\). Item information curves show where each item contributes measurement precision.

\includegraphics[width=0.92\linewidth]{figures/icc_all_items.png}
\caption{Item characteristic curves (ICCs) for author items; flagged items highlighted.}

\caption{Item information curves for highly discriminating items.}
\label{fig:iic}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Test Information and Theta Distribution}
The TIF indicates where the test measures most precisely. The test information function peaked at $\theta \approx 0.14$ with maximum information of 38.81. Precision is maximal where information is highest and standard error is lowest.

Participant ability estimates were approximately normally distributed ($M = 0.007$, $SD = 1.00$, range $= [-3.40, 3.96]$). The reliability estimate was excellent (0.965).

\label{fig:theta}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Short Form (\ShortItems\ items): Information Retention and Agreement}
The \ShortItems-item short form was constructed to retain high-information items and maintain coverage across difficulty levels. The short form retained approximately 77.3\% of full-test information (total information: 2,730 vs.\ 3,531 for full scale) and showed very high agreement with the full scale ($r \approx .97$).

\label{tab:short_candidates}
\input{tables/table_short_scale.tex}
\end{table}

\subsection{Scoring Comparisons}
We compared IRT \(\theta\) to classical scoring (hits minus false alarms) and related indices. IRT \(\theta\) showed strong correlation with classical scores ($r = .90$) and raw hit counts ($r = .99$). The weak correlation between \(\theta\) and false-alarm rate ($r = .13$) indicates that IRT scoring is relatively robust to guessing behavior.

\section{Discussion}
Overall, the Russian ART shows psychometric properties consistent with ART research in other languages: a dominant print-exposure factor; broad difficulty coverage; generally strong discrimination; and peak precision near the center of the ability distribution. The short form provides a practical alternative with limited loss of precision.

\subsection{Comparison to English ART IRT Work (Structure, Not Authors)}
English ART IRT studies (e.g., \citealp{moore2015reading}) report similar patterns: most information in the mid-range of ability, reduced precision at extremes, and strong agreement between classical and IRT scoring. The Russian ART aligns structurally with these findings while remaining culturally specific at the item-content level.

\subsection{Limitations and Next Steps}
[Add: representativeness of recruitment channels; DIF across demographics; planned cross-validation with reading speed, vocabulary, comprehension, morphosyntax; stability across time.]

\section{Conclusion}
The Russian ART provides a reliable, interpretable, and time-efficient measure of print exposure suitable for psycholinguistic research. IRT results support both full and short-form usage and enable transparent item-level diagnostics.
